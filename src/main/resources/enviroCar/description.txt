The enviroCar Project provides a public data set (Source: 52Â°North enviroCar Server) of anonymized connected car data.

These two files contain the same event records, but in one file the data is sorted by timestamp, while in the other the
data is out of order (by at most 30 seconds). Except when data is missing (i.e. when the car was turned off),
there should be an event every 5 seconds.

Schema of Connected Car Events
Each event in our connected car dataset contains 23 fields, but we will only concern ourselves with these:

id             : String  // a unique id for each event
car_id         : String  // a unique id for the car
timestamp      : long    // timestamp (milliseconds since the epoch)
longitude      : float   // GPS longitude
latitude       : float   // GPS latitude
consumption    : float   // fuel consumption (liters per hour)
speed          : float   // speed (kilometers per hour)
throttle       : float   // throttle position (%)
engineload     : float   // engine load (%)
